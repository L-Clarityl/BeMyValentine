    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Once upon a time... long, long ago...(a while back...(like over a year...))</p>
    <p>there lived a girl called Fflur and a boy called Lewis </p>
    <p>(whom we shall refer hereafter as Lew).</p>

        <figcaption> Fig. 2 - Lew </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p style="font-size: 25px;">And so...</p>
    <p>Upon being overwhelmed by her striking beauty and evident Welsh heritage,</p>
    <p>Lew took to her DMs in search of potential love...</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="journey.png" width="450" height="600" style="padding: 0;">

    </figure>

    <p>It was a journey of great anticipation.</p>
    <p>Upon arrival at the mighty gates (opening the iOS keyboard),</p>
    <p>Lew mustered up the courage to speak. And what he uttered next</p>
    <p>changed the course of Lew and Fflur's history forever...</p>

    <h2>"Very random question but I have to ask: are you welsh at all"</h2>
    <h2>"That double L in your name might be a give away"</h2>

    <p>Now, attentive reader, if you have but an eigth of the intelligence</p>
    <p>of a plastic cup, you may have noticed that Lew had made a terrible mistake.</p>
    <p>In the moment, it sort of felt like this: </p>

    <figure>

        <figcaption>Fig 3. How it felt in the moment.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>But all was not lost. Lew had made it this far and was not willing</p>
    <p>to admit defeat. And so, Fflur and Lew begin chirping like birds on a</p>
    <p>spring afternoon (texting a lot on iMessage), engaging in thrilling rounds</p>
    <p>of virtual 8 ball, selectively missing classes to watch Traitors, and the like...</p>

    <h3>A few months later...</h3>
    <p>Now the 27th of January, Fflur and Lew find themselves in an awkwardly</p>
    <p>romantic situation, as though fate were revealed through some strange</p>
    <p>foreshadowing...</p>

        <figcaption>Fig 3. How it felt in the moment.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The bright pink, the ambient lighting, the sensual music...</p>
    <p>It was all too allusive.</p>
    <p>Despite all odds, however, Fflur and Lew heartily enjoyed their meal.</p>
    <p>A meal forever to be remembered...</p>

    <h2>Months later...</h2>
    <p>Lew confesses his feelings, in such a heartwarming way it is</p>
    <p>no wonder Fflur reciprocated. The rough translation is as follows:</p>
    <h2>"Don't deep this, but I think I might be slightly like maybe beginning</h2>
    <h2>to sort of maybe kinda potentially like you."</h2>

    <p>It's the confession a girl like Fflur girl could only dream of, probably.</p>

    <p>And with that, Fflewis was born!</p>
